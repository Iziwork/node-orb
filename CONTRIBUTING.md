# Contributing to iziwork projects

Thanks for considering contributing to our projects, it means a lot to us! 
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to iziwork projects, which are hosted in the iziwork Organization on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the iziwork OSS Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to tbd@iziwork.com.

## We develop with Github

We use GitHub to host our code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Ensure your commit messages respect the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec. Our release system depends on this
7. Submit a pull request

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT software license

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if this is a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's issue feature

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Good bug reports tend to have:

* A quick summary and/or background
* Steps to reproduce (potentially a code sample)
* What you expected would happen
* What actually happens
* Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that didn't work)

## Use a consistent coding style

When contributing code to our projects, please ensure that you respect the coding style used in the codebase.
In many cases, this will be enforced by the CI.
